Context: B.2 Computing the maxEnt Oracle The maxEnt oracle prescribes the maximum intrinsic return achievable per environment instance. To simplify the computation of the maxEnt oracle score, in this section, we evaluate the maxEnt score using the L0instead of the L2norm and use the first nearest neighbor ( k= 1). In Maze, we implement the oracle using the right-hand rule [Hendrawan, 2020] for maze exploration: If there is no wall and no goal on the right, the agent turns right, otherwise, it continues straight. If there is a wall (or goal) ahead, it goes left (see Figure 3). In Jumper, we first down-sample (by average pooling) from 64×64to21×21pixels to form cells of 3×3, and the oracle score is the number of background cells (cells that the agent can visit). Here we assume that the agent has a size of 3×3 pixels. In Miner, the “easy” environment is partitioned into 10×10cells. The maximum entropy
agent is unable to match the oracle’s score. B.3 The Importance of a Memory Unit for maxEnt We evaluate the importance of memory for maxEnt: In Fig. 11a we train a maxEnt agent with and without memory (GRU). The results indicate that for Maze, the GRU is vital in order to maximize performance for all various sizes of training set. In Jumper, we see that the GRU provides an advantage when training on 200levels, however the benefit diminishes when additional training levels are available. For Miner, there appears to be no significant advantage for incorporating memory with 200training levels. However, the benefit of a GRU becomes noticeable once more training levels are available (beyond 500). When looking at the extrinsic reward (Fig. 11b), we see an interesting effect after introducing a GRU. Maze and Jumper suffer a degradation in performance with 200levels (indicating overfit), while Miner appears to be unaffected.

rewards, weighted by β(Eq. 9). Each figure details the results for different values of discount factor γ. All networks are randomly initialized and trained on 200maze levels, and their mean is computed over4runs with different seeds. The figures show an improvement over the PPO baseline for γ= 0.5. In all cases, ExpGen outperforms the combined reward agent. IDAAC [Raileanu and Fergus, 2021]. For the maximum entropy agent πHwe incorporate a single GRU [Cho et al., 2014] at the final embedding of the IMPALA convolutional architecture. For all games, we use the same parameter α= 0.5of the Geometric distribution and form an ensemble of 10networks. For further information regarding our experimental setup and specific hyperparameters, please refer to Appendix C. 6.1 Generalization Performance We compare our algorithm to six leading algorithms: vanilla PPO [Schulman et al., 2017], PLR [Jiang et al., 2021] that utilizes automatic curriculum-based learning, UCB-DrAC [Raileanu et al., 2021],
